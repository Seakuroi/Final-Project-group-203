# READ ME
## Purpose Of Each File
There is are two files in this repository. The final_project.py is the file holding all of the game concepts and code.  
We also have the readme.md which is just an explanation for how things work and how we divided up the work within the project.
## How To Run Your Program 
### *python Final_project.py*
When downloading the code from github, when you are in your terminal you just run the whole .py file.  
From there you can follow the ingame pop up prompts which help guide the user through the main gameplay loop.
## How To Play The Game
Once the game starts you will have four options to choose from.  
[1] Dig a hole - Is the main source of income for the player as they will essentially be rolling a slot machine to see the item they get.  
[2] Buy/Sell an item - You come to the shop usually after digging a hole in which you can use the items you have to gain money and buy food if needed.  
[3] Eat food - There is a hunger bar in the game and you can use the food you bought from the shopt to stay alive. To many days without eating and you will starve to death!  
[4] Sleep - This transitions the day. Your hunger bar will be decreased  and rent will be due.  
*To win*: You need to obtain 300$ before the 7 days are up!
## Annotated bibliography
From my understanding we did not use any sources outside of the INST 326 course material!
